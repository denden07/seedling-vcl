{%- comment -%}
Technical head holds all 'General / Global' assets / dependencies refererenced 
within <head> such as scripts, CSS, font references, favicons, Insites dependencies, etc. 
(Insites assets, GTM, etc..)

We try to limit assets that are part of the technical head to minimize page size 
& improve page performance.

Assets like 'Google Map API', should only be referenced as needed.
- Managed on the 'page / layout' level
